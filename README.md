# LPL Fitch Latex Converter

This tool allows to convert a proof written in LPL Fitch (exported as HTML) to LaTeX, using ["LaTeX macros for Fitch style natural deduction"](https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/fitch/) by Peter Selinger. Above this, it also contains a well-formedness and (pedantic) validity checker.

This is an example output and a corresponding preview:

For information/documentation please refer to the **Final Report** and **Project Proposal** documents (main directory of the repository).

Use the release page to download the compiled `jar` file and the slightly modified `fitch.sty` package that offers the proof format in the preview above.

This project was implemented as part of the Short Programming Project (2020-2021 iteration) at the University of Groningen.
